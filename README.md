# The-Retail-Bootcamp
A simplified way of looking and financial data to use for competitive analysis.


Description: 
This is a business tool to use for quick competitive analysis. This tool should be used to help small businesses understand industry metrics in a digestible format for most. The goal is to show sales and margins over time for certain businesses or industries. Most applications that show financial data in an easy manner do so in a manner that is more stock market research friendly verses the average consumer.  The key here is to take out the information that is used in most stock exchange applications.  Most of that information is often confusing and overwhelming for the average business.

MVP: 
Create a landing page that shows the purpose of the application.  Create a search box that would look for either company name, classification, and potentially one other option in dropdown form.  Create search results for the customerâ€™s search.  The search results will be the company name, sales, margin, net profit.



Post-MVP: 
Conduct user testing.  Update any confusing details based on user testing.  Add calculations to give gross margin rate and net profit rate.  The APIs only  Add a summary statement of the company.  Add templates and tools for users to download.
