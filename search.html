        <strong>Initial Markup (IMU%)</strong> is essentially the amount you add
        on top of the cost.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Gross Margin Rate (GM%)</strong> is essentially the IMU% less
        markdowns. This is often a target merchandise planners and finance teams
        align on to ensure the company will essentially be able to survive.
        Planners often stop here with the exception of inventory managment.
        Finance will focus more on operational numbers without necessarily being
        involved with the day to day of the product. The partnership is quite
        heavy between finance and planning. Planners have to be strategic,
        financially savvy, and concious of the product, marketing,
        competetitors, and so much more all at the same time. Time periods
        reviewed are past, present, future and often at the same time. Buyers
        and Planners go hand and hand and can sometimes switch roles. A skilled
        Buyer or Planner can often step into either role.

        <strong>Net Profit</strong> is more of a financial term which
        essentially is money left over after everything is complete.
        Understanding this number will help you understand the importance of
        IMU.
