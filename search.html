    <p><strong>Initial Markup (IMU%)</strong> is essentially the amount you add on top of the cost.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Gross Margin Rate (GM%)</strong> is essentially the IMU% less markdowns. This is often a target
      merchandise planners and
      finance teams align on to ensure the company will essentially be able to survive. Planners often stop here with
      the exception of inventory managment. Finance will focus more on operational numbers without necessarily being
      involved with the day to day of the product. The partnership is quite heavy between finance and planning. Planners
      have to be strategic, financially savvy, and concious of the product, marketing, competetitors, and so much more
      all at the same time. Time periods reviewed are past, present, future and often at the same time. Buyers and
      Planners go hand and hand and can sometimes switch roles. A skilled Buyer or Planner can often step into either
      role.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Net Profit</strong> is more of a financial term which essentially is money left over after everything is
      complete. Understanding this number will help you understand the importance of IMU.</p>
