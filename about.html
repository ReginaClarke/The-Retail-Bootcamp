    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="me" src="me.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>Regina Clarke, the creator of The Retail Bootcamp is an industry insider with well over a decade of experience of
      managing over $100 million dollar businesses at
      some of the most reputable places in the industry. As she navigates within entrepreneurial circles, she has found
      herself talking to new businesses founders who quite often find themselves
      undervaluing their good and services. These founders are often comparing their prices to established companies
      without truly understanding the metrics that are worth comparing. Learning key metrics means planning for growth.
      We as creators often forget our labor comes at a price. Profitability allows for growth and fair wages.
      Remember, you are building a business rather than a non-profit organization. You can attain profitability while
      also maintaining a concious. At The Retail Bootcamp, we'll show you how.</p>
