    <p>As an industrysdfasd insider with over a decade of experience of managing over $100 million dollar businesses at

      their good leaving little room for growth. We as creators often forget our labor comes at a price, and as we need
      to grow and hire more people, we priced in a manner that allows for that.</p>
